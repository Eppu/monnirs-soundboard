================

A damn small soundboard based on some React code.


Setup
-----

1. `yarn install`
2. Place sound files (preferably .ogg files) in the `public/assets/sounds/`-directory.
3. Copy `public/assets/config.json.example` to `public/assets/config.json` and adjust to your needs.
4. `yarn start` will launch a development server that listens to `localhost:3000`.

Build
-----

* `yarn build` generates a new production package inside the `build` directory.

Bug? Feature idea?
